<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The vast majority of modern APIs driving data to web and mobile applications use
HTTP <xref target="RFC7230"/> as their protocol. The health and uptime of these APIs
determine availability of the applications themselves. In distributed systems
built with a number of APIs, understanding the health status of the APIs and
making corresponding decisions, for caching, failover or circuit-breaking, are
essential to the ability of providing highly-available solutions.</t>

<t>There exists a wide variety of operational software that relies on the ability
to read health check response of APIs. However, there is currently no standard
for the health check output response, so most applications either rely on the
basic level of information included in HTTP status codes <xref target="RFC7231"/> or use
task-specific formats.</t>

<t>Usage of task-specific or application-specific formats creates significant
challenges, disallowing any meaningful interoperability across different
implementations and between different tooling.</t>

<t>Standardizing a format for health checks can provide any of a number of
benefits, including:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Flexible deployment - since operational tooling and API clients can rely on
rich, uniform format, they can be safely combined and substituted as needed.</t>
  <t>Evolvability - new APIs, conforming to the standard, can safely be introduced
in any environment and ecosystem that also conforms to the same standard,
without costly coordination and testing requirements.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This document defines a “health check” format using the JSON format <xref target="RFC8259"/>
for APIs to use as a standard point for the health information they offer.
Having a well-defined format for this purpose promotes good practice and
tooling.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,
“SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="api-health-response" title="API Health Response">

<t>Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs uses the JSON format described in
<xref target="RFC8259"/> and has the media type “application/health+json”.</t>

<t>Its content consists of a single mandatory root field (“status”) and several
optional fields:</t>

<section anchor="status" title="status">

<t>status: (required) indicates whether the service status is acceptable or not.
API publishers SHOULD use following values for the field:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>“pass”: healthy (acceptable aliases: “ok” to support Node’s Terminus and
“up” for Java’s SpringBoot),</t>
  <t>“fail”: unhealthy (acceptable aliases: “error” to support Node’s Terminus and
“down” for Java’s SpringBoot), and</t>
  <t>“warn”: healthy, with some concerns.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The value of the status field is case-insensitive and is tightly related with
  the HTTP response code returned by the health endpoint. For “pass” status,
  HTTP response code in the 2xx-3xx range MUST be used. For “fail” status,
  HTTP response code in the 4xx-5xx range MUST be used. In case of the “warn”
  status, endpoints MUST return HTTP status in the 2xx-3xx range, and
  additional information SHOULD be provided, utilizing optional fields of the
  response.</t>

<t>A health endpoint is only meaningful in the context of the component it
  indicates the health of. It has no other meaning or purpose. As such, its
  health is a conduit to the health of the component. Clients SHOULD assume that
  the HTTP response code returned by the health endpoint is applicable to the
  entire component (e.g. a larger API or a microservice). This is compatible
  with the behavior that current infrastructural tooling expects:
  load-balancers, service discoveries and others, utilizing health-checks.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="version" title="version">

<t>version: (optional) public version of the service.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="releaseid" title="releaseId">

<t>releaseId: (optional) in well-designed APIs, backwards-compatible changes in
  the service should not update a version number. APIs usually change their
  version number as infrequently as possible, to preserve stable interface.
  However, implementation of an API may change much more frequently, which leads
  to the importance of having separate “release number” or “releaseId” that is
  different from the public version of the API.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="notes" title="notes">

<t>notes: (optional) array of notes relevant to current state of health</t>

</section>
<section anchor="output" title="output">

<t>output: (optional) raw error output, in case of “fail” or “warn” states. This
  field SHOULD be omitted for “pass” state.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="checks" title="checks">

<t>checks (optional) is an object that provides detailed health statuses of
additional downstream systems and endpoints which can affect the overall health
of the main API. Please refer to the “The Checks Object” section for more
information.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="links" title="links">

<t>links (optional) is an object containing link relations and URIs
<xref target="RFC3986"/> for external links that MAY contain more information about the
health of the endpoint. All values of this object SHALL be URIs. Keys MAY
also be URIs. Per web-linking standards <xref target="RFC8288"/> a link
relationship SHOULD either be a common/registered one or be indicated as a URI,
to avoid name clashes.  If a “self” link is provided, it MAY be used by clients
to check health via HTTP response code, as mentioned above.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="serviceid" title="serviceId">

<t>serviceId (optional) is a unique identifier of the service, in the application
scope.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="description" title="description">

<t>description (optional) is a human-friendly description of the service.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="the-checks-object" title="The Checks Object">

<t>The “checks” object MAY have a number of unique keys, one for each logical
downstream dependency or sub-component. Since each sub-component may be
backed by several nodes with varying health statuses, these keys point to arrays
of objects. In case of a single-node sub-component (or if presence of nodes is
not relevant), a single-element array SHOULD be used as the value, for
consistency.</t>

<t>The key identifying an element in the object SHOULD be a unique string within
the details section. It MAY have two parts: “{componentName}:{measurementName}”,
in which case the meaning of the parts SHOULD be as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>componentName: (optional) human-readable name for the component. MUST not
contain a colon, in the name, since colon is used as a separator.</t>
  <t>measurementName: (optional) name of the measurement type (a data point type)
that the status is reported for. MUST not contain a colon, in the name, since
colon is used as a separator. The observation’s name can be one of:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>A pre-defined value from this spec. Pre-defined values include:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>utilization</t>

          <t>connections</t>
          <t>uptime</t>
        </list></t>
      <t>A common and standard term from a well-known source such as schema.org, IANA
or microformats.</t>
      <t>A URI that indicates extra semantics and processing rules that MAY be
provided by a resource at the other end of the URI. URIs do not have to be
dereferenceable, however. They are just a namespace, and the meaning of a
namespace CAN be provided by any convenient means (e.g. publishing an RFC,
Open API Spec document or a nicely printed book).</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>On the value side of the equation, each “component details” object in the array
SHOULD have at least one key, and MAY have any or none of the following object keys:</t>

<section anchor="componentid" title="componentId">

<t>componentId: (optional) is a unique identifier of an instance of a specific
sub-component/dependency of a service. Multiple objects with the same
componentID MAY appear in the details, if they are from different nodes.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="componenttype" title="componentType">

<t>componentType: (optional) SHOULD be present if componentName is present. It’s
a type of the component and could be one of:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Pre-defined value from this spec. Pre-defined values include:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>component</t>
      <t>datastore</t>

    </list></t>
  <t>A common and standard term from a well-known source such as schema.org, IANA

  <t>A URI that indicates extra semantics and processing rules that MAY be
provided by a resource at the other end of the URI. URIs do not have to be
dereferenceable, however. They are just a namespace, and the meaning of a

Swagger document or a nicely printed book).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="observedvalue" title="observedValue">

<t>observedValue: (optional) could be any valid JSON value, such as: string, number,
object, array or literal.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="observedunit" title="observedUnit">

<t>observedUnit (optional) SHOULD be present if observedValue is present. Clarifies
the unit of measurement in which observedUnit is reported, e.g. for a time-based
value it is important to know whether the time is reported in seconds, minutes,
hours or something else. To make sure unit is denoted by a well-understood name
or an abbreviation, it SHOULD be one of:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A common and standard term from a well-known source such as schema.org, IANA,
microformats, or a standards document such as <xref target="RFC3339"/>.</t>

Swagger document or a nicely printed book).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="status-1" title="status">

<t>status (optional) has the exact same meaning as the top-level “output”
element, but for the sub-component/downstream dependency represented
by the details object.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="affectedendpoints" title="affectedEndpoints">

<t>A typical API has many URI endpoints. Most of the time we are interested in
the overall health of the API, without diving into details. That said, sometimes
operational and resilience middleware needs to know more details about the health
of the API (which is why “checks” property provides details). In such cases,
we often need to indicate which particular endpoints are affected by a particular
check’s troubles vs. other endpoints that may be fine. The <spanx style="verb">affectedEndpoints</spanx>
property is a JSON array containing URI Templates as defined by <xref target="RFC6570"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="time" title="time">

<t>time (optional) is the date-time, in ISO8601 format, at which the reading of the
observedValue was recorded. This assumes that the value can be cached and the
reading typically doesn’t happen in real time, for performance and scalability
purposes.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="output-1" title="output">

<t>output (optional) has the exact same meaning as the top-level “output”
element, but for the sub-component/downstream dependency represented

<section anchor="creating-and-serving-health-responses" title="Creating and Serving Health Responses">

<t>When making an health check endpoint available, there are a few things to keep
in mind:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A health response endpoint is best located at a memorable and commonly-used
URI, such as “health” because it will help self-discoverability by clients.</t>
  <t>Health check responses can be personalized. For example, you could advertise
different URIs, and/or different kinds of link relations, to afford different
clients access to additional health check information.</t>
  <t>Health check responses SHOULD be assigned a freshness lifetime (e.g.,
“Cache-Control: max-age=3600”) so that clients can determine how long they
could cache them, to avoid overly frequent fetching and unintended DDOS-ing of
the service. Any method of cache lifetime negotiation provided by HTTP spec is
acceptable (e.g. ETags are just fine).</t>
  <t>Custom link relation types, as well as the URIs for variables, SHOULD lead to
documentation for those constructs.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="consuming-health-check-responses" title="Consuming Health Check Responses">

<t>Clients might use health check responses in a variety of ways.</t>

<t>Note that the health check response is a “living” document; links from the
health check response MUST NOT be assumed to be valid beyond the freshness
lifetime of the health check response, as per HTTP’s caching model <xref target="RFC7234"/>.</t>

<t>As a result, clients ought to cache the health check response (as per
<xref target="RFC7234"/>), to avoid fetching it before every interaction (which would
otherwise be required).</t>

<t>Likewise, a client encountering a 404 (Not Found) on a link is encouraged to obtain
a fresh copy of the health check response, to assure that it is up-to-date.</t>
