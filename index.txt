1.  Introduction

   The vast majority of modern APIs driving data to web and mobile
   applications use HTTP [RFC7230] as their protocol.  The health and
   uptime of these APIs determine availability of the applications
   themselves.  In distributed systems built with a number of APIs,
   understanding the health status of the APIs and making corresponding
   decisions, for failover or circuit-breaking, are essential for
   providing highly available solutions.

   There exists a wide variety of operational software that relies on
   the ability to read health check response of APIs.  There is
   currently no standard for the health check output response, however,

   so most applications either rely on the basic level of information
   included in HTTP status codes [RFC7231] or use task-specific formats.

   Usage of task-specific or application-specific formats creates
   significant challenges, disallowing any meaningful interoperability
   across different implementations and between different tooling.

   Standardizing a format for health checks can provide any of a number
   of benefits, including:

   o  Flexible deployment - since operational tooling and API clients
      can rely on rich, uniform format, they can be safely combined and
      substituted as needed.

   o  Evolvability - new APIs, conforming to the standard, can safely be
      introduced in any environment and ecosystem that also conforms to
      the same standard, without costly coordination and testing
      requirements.

   This document defines a "health check" format using the JSON format
   [RFC8259] for APIs to use as a standard point for the health
   information they offer.  Having a well-defined format for this
   purpose promotes good practice and tooling.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  API Health Response

   The API Health Response Format (or, interchangeably, "health check
   response format") uses the JSON format described in [RFC8259] and has
   the media type "application/vnd.health+json".

   Its content consists of a single mandatory root field ("status") and
   several optional fields:

   o  status: (required) indicates whether the service status is
      acceptable or not.  API publishers SHOULD use following values for
      the field:

      *  "pass": healthy,

      *  "fail": unhealthy, and

      *  "warn": healthy, with some concerns.



Nadareishvili            Expires August 2, 2018                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs   January 2018


      The health endpoint SHOULD always respond with a success (2xx-3xx,
      typically: HTTP 200) response code, for any of the status levels,
      unless the health endpoint itself is malfunctioning.

   o  version: (optional) public version of the service.

   o  releaseID: (optional) in well-designed APIs, backwards-compatible
      changes in the service should not update a version number.  APIs
      usually change their version number as infrequently as possible,
      to preserve stable interface.  However implementation of an API
      may change much more frequently, which leads to the importance of
      having separate "release number" or "releaseID" that is different
      from the public version of the API.

   o  notes: (optional) array of notes relevant to current state of
      health

   o  output: (optional) raw error output, in case of "fail" or "warn"
      states.  This field SHOULD be omitted for "pass" state.

   o  details: (optional) an object representing status of sub-
      components of the service in question.  Please refer to the "The
      Details Object" section for more information.

   o  links: (optional) an array of objects containing link relations
      and URIs [RFC3986] for external links that MAY contain more
      information about the health of the endpoint.  Per web-linking
      standards [RFC5988] a link relationship SHOULD either be a common/
      registered one or be indicated as a URI, to avoid name clashes.
      If a "self" link is provided, it MAY be used by clients to check
      health via HTTP response code, as mentioned above.

   o  serviceID: (optional) unique identifier of the service, in the
      application scope.

   o  description: (optional) human-friendly description of the service.

4.  The Details Object

   The "details" object MAY have a number of unique keyes, one for each
   logical sub-components.  Since each sub-component may be backed by
   several nodes with varying health statuses, the key points to an
   array of objects.  In case of a single-node sub-component (or if
   presence of nodes is not relevant), a single-element array should be
   used as the value, for consistency.

   The key identifying an element in the object should be a unique
   string within the details section.  It MAY have two parts:

   "{componentName}:{metricName}", in which case the meaning of the
   parts SHOULD be as follows:

   o  componentName: (optional) human-readable name for the component.
      MUST not contain a colon, in the name, since colon is used as a
      separator.

   o  metricName: (optional) name of the metrics that the status is
      reported for.  MUST not contain a colon, in the name, since colon
      is used as a separator and can be one of:

      *  Pre-defined value from this spec.  Pre-defined values include:

         +  utilization

         +  responseTime

         +  connections

         +  uptime

      *  A common and standard term from a well-known source such as
         schema.org, IANA or microformats.

      *  A URI that indicates extra semantics and processing rules that
         MAY be provided by a resource at the other end of the URI.
         URIs do not have to be dereferenceable, however.  They are just
         a namespace, and the meaning of a namespace CAN be provided by
         any convenient means (e.g. publishing an RFC, Swagger document
         or a nicely printed book).

   On the value eside of the equation, each "component details" object
   in the array MAY have one of the following object keys:

   o  componentId: (optional) unique identifier of an instance of a
      specific sub-component/dependency of a service.  Multiple objects
      with the same componentID MAY appear in the details, if they are
      from different nodes.

   o  componentType: (optional) SHOULD be present if componentName is
      present.  Type of the component.  Could be one of:

      *  Pre-defined value from this spec.  Pre-defined values include:

         +  component

         +  datastore

         +  system

      *  A common and standard term from a well-known source such as
         schema.org, IANA or microformats.

      *  A URI that indicates extra semantics and processing rules that
         MAY be provided by a resource at the other end of the URI.
         URIs do not have to be dereferenceable, however.  They are just
         a namespace, and the meaning of a namespace CAN be provided by
         any convenient means (e.g. publishing an RFC, Swagger document
         or a nicely printed book).

   o  metricValue: (optional) could be any valid JSON value, such as:
      string, number, object, array or literal.

   o  metricUnit: (optional) SHOULD be present if metricValue is
      present.  Could be one of:

      *  A common and standard term from a well-known source such as
         schema.org, IANA, microformats, or a standards document such as
         [RFC3339].

      *  A URI that indicates extra semantics and processing rules that
         MAY be provided by a resource at the other end of the URI.
         URIs do not have to be dereferenceable, however.  They are just
         a namespace, and the meaning of a namespace CAN be provided by
         any convenient means (e.g. publishing an RFC, Swagger document
         or a nicely printed book).

   o  time: the date-time, in ISO8601 format, at which the reading of
      the metricValue was recorded.  This assumes that the value can be
      cached and the reading typically doesn't happen in real time, for
      performance and scalability purposes.

   o  output: (optional) has the exact same meaning as the top-level
      "output" element, but for the sub-component.

   o  links: (optional) has the exact same meaning as the top-level
      "output" element, but for the sub-component.

6.  Security Considerations

   Clients need to exercise care when reporting health information.
   Malicious actors could use this information for orchestrating
   attacks.  In some cases the health check endpoints may need to be
   authenticated and institute role-based access control.

Appendix B.  Creating and Serving Health Responses

   When making an health check endpoint available, there are a few
   things to keep in mind:

   o  A health response endpoint is best located at a memorable and
      commonly-used URI, such as "health" because it will help self-
      discoverability by clients.

   o  Health check responses can be personalized.  For example, you
      could advertise different URIs, and/or different kinds of link
      relations, to afford different clients access to additional health
      check information.

   o  Health check responses must be assigned a freshness lifetime
      (e.g., "Cache-Control: max-age=3600") so that clients can

      determine how long they could cache them, to avoid overly frequent
      fetching and unintended DDOS-ing of the service.

   o  Custom link relation types, as well as the URIs for variables,
      should lead to documentation for those constructs.

Appendix C.  Consuming Health Check Responses

   Clients might use health check responses in a variety of ways.

   Note that the health check response is a "living" document; links
   from the health check response MUST NOT be assumed to be valid beyond
   the freshness lifetime of the health check response, as per HTTP's
   caching model [RFC7234].

   As a result, clients ought to cache the health check response (as per
   [RFC7234]), to avoid fetching it before every interaction (which
   would otherwise be required).

   Likewise, a client encountering a 404 (Not Found) on a link is
   encouraged to obtain a fresh copy of the health check response, to
   assure that it is up-to-date.
